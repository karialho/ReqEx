# ReqEx
ReqEx is a standalone export tool for Micro Focus Caliber. It provides exporting projects/requirement types from Caliber into Excel (.xlsx) or ReqIF files.

Building ReqEx requires the proprietary Caliber SDK Java library (version 11.5 or higher) that is distributed with Caliber. The SDK takes care of connecting to a Caliber server, and you naturally also need to have valid user credentials with rights to the projects you wish to export.

The ReqEx tool is developed and copyrighted by ImproveIt Oy, and licensed with the Apache License 2.0.
